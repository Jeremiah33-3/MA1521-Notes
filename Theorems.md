# Most theorems in Thomas Calculus textbook

## Chapter 2: Limits 
1. Theorem 1: Limit Laws
   - sum, difference, product, division, constant mulitple, power, root rules
2. Theorem 2: Limits on polynomial
   - If P(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + g + a0, then lim(x->c)P(x) = P(c) = anx^c +... + a^0
   - polynomial is continuous
3. Theorem 3: Limits on rational funcitons
   - If P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials and Q(c) ≠ 0, then lim(x->c)(P(x)/Q(x)) = P(c)/Q(c)
4. Theorem 4: The Sandiwch Theorem
   - Suppose that g(x) <= ƒ(x) <= h(x) for all x in some open interval containing c, except possibly at x = c itself. Suppose also that lim(x->c)g(x) = lim(x->c)h(x) = L. Then lim(x->c)f(x) = L
6. Theorem 6:
   - Suppose that a function f is defined on an open interval containing c, except perhaps at c itself. Then ƒ(x) has a limit as x approaches c if and only if it has left-hand and right-hand limits there and these one-sided limits are equal: lim(x->c)f(x) = L <=> left side and right side equal (lim...)
7. Theorem 7: Limit of the Ratio (sin x)/x as x -> 0 = 1 (x in radians)
8. Theorem 8: Properties of Continuous Functions
   - If the functions ƒ and g are continuous at x = c, then the following algebraic combinations are continuous at x = c:
     a. sums
     b. difference
     c. constant multiples
     d. product
     e. quotient 
     f. powers
     g. roots
9. Compositions of Continuous Functions
    - If ƒ is continuous at c and g is continuous at ƒ(c), then the composition g ∘ ƒ is continuous at c.
10. Limits of Continuous Functions
    - If lim(x->c)ƒ(x) = b and g is continuous at the point b, then lim(x->c)g(f(x)) = g(b)
11. The Intermediate Value Theorem for Continuous Functions
    - If ƒ is a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b], and if y0 is any value between ƒ(a) and ƒ(b), then y0 = ƒ(c) for some c in [a, b].
12. Theorem 12:
    - All the Limit Laws in Theorem 1 are true when we replace lim(x->c) by lim(x->∞) or lim(x->-∞).
    - That is, the variable x may approach a finite number c or +-∞.
